# **Solo Server JS**

**Local AI Orchestration to Make Privacy and Performance Possible**  
A modular, extensible, and high-performance framework for running AI tasks locally, designed with privacy, portability, and scalability at its core.

---

## **Overview**

Solo Server JS enables developers to orchestrate AI tasks on local devices with minimal setup. By leveraging on-device computation, it ensures privacy, reduces latency, and eliminates cloud dependency. With built-in tools for benchmarking and profiling, Solo Server JS is perfect for building cutting-edge AI solutions.

---

## **Features**

### 🔒 **Privacy by Design**
All computations happen locally on the device, ensuring that your data never leaves your system.

### ⚡ **High Performance**
Optimized for low-latency AI tasks, with support for on-device acceleration (e.g., GPUs, TPUs).

### 🔧 **Extensible**
Add custom AI tasks or categories with ease using the modular architecture.

### 📊 **Benchmarking and Profiling**
Integrated tools for performance measurement, resource utilization analysis, and optimization.

### 🌐 **Wide Compatibility**
Supports multiple AI domains:
- **NLP**: Tasks like Fill-Mask, Question Answering, Sentence Similarity
- **Vision**: Image Classification, Object Detection, Image Segmentation
- **Audio**: ASR, Text-to-Speech, Audio Classification

## **Installation**

Install Solo Server JS using npm:

```bash
npm install solo-server-js
```

---

## **Quick Start**

### **1. Start the Server**
Run the server to access AI tasks locally:

```javascript
const soloServer = require('solo-server-js');

soloServer.start(() => {
  console.log('Solo Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

### **2. Run an AI Task**
Use the built-in tasks for quick results. Example: **Fill-Mask** (NLP task):

```javascript
const { run } = require('solo-server-js/src/categories/nlp/fillMask');

const result = await run({
  sentence: 'The sky is [MASK].',
  mask: '[MASK]'
});

console.log(result); // Output: "The sky is <predicted-word>."
```
